  <br> I am a MS in Geography and Environmental Sustainability with a concentration in Geospatial Technologies at University of Oklahoma and park aide with Sonoma County Parks.
  I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Science from Creighton University in 2020. I obtained my Eagle Scout on August 4, 2016.<br>
  
  <br> My current interests are in the fields of Environmental History, Parks and Recreation, Environmental Justice, and climate and fire studies. I look forward to adding more to this portfolio as I 
  continue growing in the Geospatial Technologies field! <br>
